    <h1> Fund 'Em When They're Young: Better Funding Before High School Catalyzes Higher Graduation Rates </h1>
    <h3> By Lux Hogan-Murphy and Cliff Stowe </h3>

        <h2> Vocabulary: </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> <h5> Per pupil spending: Amount of money spent on education in a given area (school, school district, county, state, etc) divided by the number of students that attend school in that area. This helps account for differences in the budgets between regions with vastly different numbers of students.
</h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Elementary-secondary school systems: A cumulative look at all of the elementary and middle schools in a given region. </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR): Number of students who graduated high school divided by the number of students who entered ninth grade four years prior in a given region. </h5></li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Our analyses according to UX design principles: </h2>
        <h4> Analysis of Lux's sketches: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> <h5> Modeling: Scatter plot graph of spending versus graduation rate shows the correlation (if any) between variables most plainly. The macro and micro summary graphs seamlessly link together, allowing the user to create a conceptual model of how counties operate within states and give average values for each variable.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Visibility: All of the axes are labelled and include units, and the states which will have micro summary pages are also labelled. It is easy for users to understand what data is being compared and how the variables relate.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Consistency: Each graph has the same variables, meaning the graphs are easily comparable for users.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Structure: State graphs are all accessible in the same way, and they can simultaneously exist as offshoots of the main, national graph.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Simplicity: The graphs are simplifications of the numerical data. Lines of best fit allow for users to interpret the correlation between variables more clearly, which would not be as simple a connection with solely points in a scatter plot.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Documentation: The key does a good job of documenting what the purple dashed line is, a best fit line. The axes explain what the graph is comparing and the title gives a more detailed explanation of the variables. There could be a more information about what “graduation rate” actually means, or even what “spending” means.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Achievability: Scatter plots are the simplest way to represent our data (requires the least manipulation of our data) because the variables that the scatter plot compares are the same as the variables that our data is organized according to (as opposed to say, geographical regions), so they will be most achievable for us to create.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Signifiers: The axis titles and labels on the data points give viewers a good understanding of what the graph is comparing.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Feedback: There is very little feedback in this design because the graph is not very interactive. For example, users can not click on particular dots on the graph and so no feedback is given when a user hovers their mouse over a dot, or even if they click on a dot. Users are not told which state or county they are looking at when they click on it.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Perceptibility: Red (or pink) and green are not distinguishable to all users, although it is not necessary to see the difference in axis title color to understand the gist of the data. Because many of the dots are so close together, it can be difficult to see how data points differ and to identify individual data points. This also does not leave room for labelling all of the data points, which means that there is some omitted information.
          </h5></li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Analysis of Cliff's sketches: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> <h5> Modeling: Users are familiar with maps and can understand how a map of the nation leads to maps of regions in the nation. The maps are connected by location, allowing the user to create a conceptual model of how counties operate within states. If a user wants to know more about a specific point, they can hover over it and see data related to the point the user is choosing to hover over.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Visibility: The national map is visible immediately, and it is clear that clicking on a particularly colored region of the map will result in seeing a subset of the nation on another map.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Consistency: Data on each map can be accessed in the same way, with users hovering over either states or counties in an easily understandable and consistent way, whether the user is at a national or regional level.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Structure: Regional maps are all accessed in the same way, and they all exist as branches of the main map.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Simplicity: Maps simplify data so that users can visualize location, and the live representation of specific data allows users to see individual pieces of data without being overwhelmed by more data.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Documentation: Clear instructions will allow users to understand how to properly use the maps and access the data they want.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Achievability: Maps are not easy to create, especially more detailed maps for regions of the country, so this design is not easily achievable.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Signifiers: Colors distinguish between regions on the map, and those colors signify individual regions that users can click on.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Feedback: The data shown after hovering over a region provides feedback showing that the user is clicking on a valid region, and the data provided aids the user’s experience in using the page.
          </h5></li>
          <li> <h5> Perceptibility: Red and green are not distinguishable to all users, and distinguishing colors of regions is imperative to understanding each infographic. In regions with small counties, it may be difficult to see each county or find data for that county due to its size.
          </h5></li>
        </ul>

        <h2> How we combined our sketches: </h2>
        <h4> Elements used from Lux's sketches: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Using scatter plots to represent our data </li>
          <li> The hierarchy of macro-summaries and micro-summaries </li>
          <li> Labelling clickable states that have micro-summaries attached to them </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Elements used from the Cliff's sketches: </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> Hovering over regions to see data about them </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Our project pipeline: </h2>
            <img src="pipeline.png" alt="project pipeline" style="height:60%;" style="width:70%">
            <p> Starting with our joint project schematic, we will generate a basic scatter plot to match our schematic. At the same time, we will consolidate and format our data to eventually feed into that scatter plot template by matching the location names on both the funding and graduation rate data sets. This will all be happening in the evening of November 16. After that, we will jointly design the macro-summary page using the scatter plot and the formatted data. We will then simultaneously generate ten micro-summary pages and design a framework for navigating to those pages from the macro-summary page, and finally work together to finalize the project and analyze the data shown in our infographics.
            </p>
       <h2> Our division of labor: </h2>
       <p> The splits in our project pipeline designate where will be dividing the labor in our project. Cliff will generate the basic scatter plot and create the micro-summary pages, while Lux will consolidate the data and design a framework for navigating to the micro-summary pages. We believe this is a fair and reasonable division of labor, and we will be working jointly when our pipeline has only one option.
